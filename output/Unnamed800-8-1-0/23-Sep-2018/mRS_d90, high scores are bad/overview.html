</h1></center><hr><h2>Analysis summary</h2><p>This analysis named 'Unnamed800-8-1-0' tested the hypothesis (high scores are bad) that there is a relationship between lesion status and the behavior score 'mRS_d90'. 296 subjects were listed for inclusion, and 27 were excluded due to missing behavioral data, lesion data, or for having no voxels inside the minimum lesion cutoff mask (1-01-037-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 1-06-018-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 1-06-108-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 1-06-111-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 1-06-121-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 1-07-001-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 1-07-004-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 1-07-006-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 1-07-007-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 1-07-009-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 1-12-005-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 1-19-009-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 2-01-014-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 2-01-018-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 2-01-031-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 2-01-065-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 2-01-074-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 2-01-091-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 2-01-114-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 2-03-007-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 2-04-065-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 2-04-068-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 4-02-001-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 6-01-039-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 6-01-048-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 6-04-013-v03LesionMaskToMNI, 6-04-029-v03LesionMaskToMNI). Data was corrected for lesion volume via Regress on Both. No other covariates were specified. The resulting SVR-&beta; values were thresholded at p < .005 and corrected for cluster size at p < .05, both based on 800 permutations. The analysis was restricted to voxels with at least 10 overlapping lesions. The analysis was run on 23-Sep-2018 using MATLAB's SVR procedures (parallelized,  not run from the GUI), with parameters gamma = 5 and cost = 30.Hyperparameter optimization was not  utilized. The analysis completed in 2 minutes and 4 seconds.</p><hr><h2>Lesion overlaps</h2><p>Overlap of lesions in the patient sample (N = 296), a green outline indicates regions meeting the minimum lesion overlap criterion for the analysis (N = 10) totaling 48617 or approximately 41% of the 118652 voxels with any lesions present.<br></p><img src="images/lesion_overlap.png" alt="Overlap of lesions in the patient sample (N = 296), a green outline indicates regions meeting the minimum lesion overlap criterion for the analysis (N = 10) totaling 48617 or approximately 41% of the 118652 voxels with any lesions present.<br>" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>

<hr><h2>Hyperparameter Quality Report</h2>The final SVR model did converge. The model had parameters Cost/BoxConstraint = 30.00, Sigma/KernelScale = 0.45, Epsilon = 0.10, and Standardize = true. The final model utilized data points from 296 of the 296 observations (individual subjects) as support vectors. The final model had a bias of -0.15. Average prediction accuracy is -0.09 (SD = 0.04) and average reproducibility index is r =  0.87 (SD = 0.04). Average mean absolute difference between real and predicted behaviors is 21.77 (SD = 0.03).<br><br><img src="images/param_quality.png" alt="Parameter quality plots"><br><br></body></html>
